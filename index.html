            <p>Here's our guide to playing the trumpet. 
                It is suited best for those beginning to play. 
                This guide will get you started on the basic principles of trumpet playing.</p>
            <p> Playing the trumpet is exciting to learn! Remember you are just starting out so your muscles will get tired. It's better to practice a little every day than a lot once or twice a week.
                Remember to rest when you feel your chops tired. As a general rule, rest twice as much as you play and avoid using excessive mouth pressure. </p>

                    <li>Thumb on the 1st valve slide (most trumpets have a hook for the thumb></li>
                    <li>Index and middle finger wrap around the 3rd valve casing</li>
                    <li>Ring finger in the 3rd valve slide ring</li>
                    <li>Pinky under 3rd valve slide (or wherever is comfortable)</li>
                </ul>
                The instrument should be supported by the left hand. This allows you to push the valves more efficiently with your right hand.

                    <li><strong>Do not hook your pinky inside the ring. This can cause valve damage from exessive and uneven pressure when pushing the valves down.</strong></li>

        <p>It's usually recommended to have as much lower lip as the upper one in the mouthpiece. 
            There are individual differences in teeth, lips and skull so place the mouthpiece to the most comfortable and natural spot for you. 
            If the mouthpiece is significantly more on either lip, it's recommended to adjust it a little bit more center. 
            Sometimes it's advised to have a little more upper than lower lip in the mouthpiece 
            (based on the idea that the mouthpiece "sits" on the lower lip so there is minimum pressure applied to the upper lip, allowing it to vibrate more freely).</p>
