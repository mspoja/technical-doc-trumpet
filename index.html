            <p>Here's our guide to playing the trumpet. 
                It is suited best for those beginning to play. 
                This guide will get you started on the basic principles of trumpet playing.</p>
            <p> Playing the trumpet is exciting to learn! Remember you are just starting out so your muscles will get tired. It's better to practice a little every day than a lot once or twice a week.
                Remember to rest when you feel your chops tired. As a general rule, rest twice as much as you play. 
                Avoid excessive mouthpiece pressure, although some is needed for proper tone and to avoid air leaking under the mouthpiece. </p>
